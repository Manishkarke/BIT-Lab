            As government aides were frantically preparing for the president’s
            last-minute. Internet-reliability summit with technology leaders,
            thousands of visitors couldn’t reach the U.S. Senate’s own Web site.
            It was offline for over nine hours Monday, from early afternoon to
            after 11 pm (EST) due to technical problems, Senate officials said.
            The embarrassing site failure comes just as the U.S. government is
            telling private firms how important it is that they increase the
            reliability and security of their own networks.

            The attorney general of Michigan has filed a “notice of intended
            action” against Double click, charging the Web advertising firm with
            “failing to disclose to Internet users that Double click is
            systematically implanting electronic ‘cookies’, or electronic
            surveillance files, on hard drives of users’ computers without their
            knowledge or consent”. In addition, the notice criticizes Double
            click’s recent attempts to combine its tracking data such as names
            obtained through its acquisition of Abacus Direct last year.
